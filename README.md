## Domain 1: Cloud Concepts (26%)

### What is Cloud Computing?
Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.

### Six Advantages of Cloud Computing

1. **Trade capital expense for variable expense**
   - No upfront costs, pay only for what you consume
   - Convert CapEx to OpEx

2. **Benefit from massive economies of scale**
   - AWS achieves higher economies of scale
   - Lower variable costs than you can achieve on your own

3. **Stop guessing about capacity**
   - Eliminate guessing on infrastructure capacity needs
   - Scale up/down as needed

4. **Increase speed and agility**
   - Resources available in minutes, not weeks
   - Experiment quickly with low cost and risk

5. **Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers**
   - Focus on customers, not infrastructure
   - Let AWS handle the heavy lifting

6. **Go global in minutes**
   - Deploy applications in multiple regions worldwide
   - Lower latency and better customer experience

### Identity and Access Management (IAM)

#### Core Components

**Users**
- Represents a person or application
- Has permanent long-term credentials
- Default: No permissions (implicit deny)

**Groups**
- Collection of users
- Users inherit group permissions
- Cannot be nested
- Use for job functions (Developers, Admins)

**Roles**
- Temporary security credentials
- Can be assumed by users, applications, or services
- No permanent credentials
- Use for: EC2 instances, cross-account access, applications

**Policies**
- JSON documents defining permissions
- Define what actions are allowed/denied on which resources
- Can be attached to users, groups, or roles

#### IAM Policy Structure
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::mybucket/*",
      "Condition": {
        "IpAddress": {
          "aws:SourceIp": "203.0.113.0/24"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

#### IAM Best Practices
1. **Enable MFA** for all users, especially root
2. **Principle of least privilege** - minimal permissions needed
3. **Use roles for applications** running on EC2

A company wants to migrate their on-premises data center to AWS. They want to maintain the same level of control over the operating system and applications. Which cloud service model should they choose?

A) Software as a Service (SaaS)
B) Platform as a Service (PaaS)
C) Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
D) Function as a Service (FaaS)

**Answer: C) Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**
*Explanation: IaaS provides the most control over the operating system and applications, similar to on-premises infrastructure.*

#### Question 2: Security
According to the AWS Shared Responsibility Model, which of the following is the customer's responsibility?

A) Physical security of data centers
B) Hypervisor patching
C) Network infrastructure security
D) Operating system patching on EC2 instances

**Answer: D) Operating system patching on EC2 instances**
*Explanation: Customers are responsible for guest OS patching, while AWS handles infrastructure-level security.*

#### Question 3: Technology
A web application experiences variable traffic throughout the day. Which EC2 pricing model would be most cost-effective for handling the variable load?

A) On-Demand Instances only
B) Reserved Instances only
C) Spot Instances only
D) Combination of Reserved Instances for baseline and On-Demand for peaks

**Answer: D) Combination of Reserved Instances for baseline and On-Demand for peaks**
*Explanation: Use Reserved Instances for predictable baseline load and scale with On-Demand instances for traffic spikes.*

#### Question 4: Billing
Which AWS service provides detailed billing information and can forecast future costs based on historical usage?

A) AWS Budgets  
B) AWS Cost Explorer
C) AWS Pricing Calculator
D) AWS Cost and Usage Report

**Answer: B) AWS Cost Explorer**
*Explanation: Cost Explorer analyzes historical data and provides cost forecasting capabilities.*

### Scenario-Based Questions

#### Scenario 1: Storage Selection
A company needs to store backup data that will be accessed once or twice per year for compliance purposes. The data must be stored for 7 years. Cost is the primary concern.

**Best solution**: S3 Glacier Deep Archive
**Reasoning**: Lowest cost storage class, designed for long-term archive with infrequent access.

#### Scenario 2: Database Choice
An e-commerce application needs a database that can handle millions of requests per second with predictable performance and automatic scaling.

**Best solution**: Amazon DynamoDB
**Reasoning**: NoSQL database designed for high-performance applications with automatic scaling.

#### Scenario 3: Disaster Recovery
A company needs to implement disaster recovery with RTO of 4 hours and RPO of 1 hour at minimal cost.

**Best solution**: Pilot Light strategy
**Reasoning**: Meets RTO/RPO requirements while maintaining low costs with minimal infrastructure.

## Final Exam Preparation

### Last-Minute Review Checklist

#### Must-Know Services ✓
- **Compute**: EC2, Lambda, Elastic Beanstalk
- **Storage**: S3 (all classes), EBS, EFS
- **Database**: RDS, DynamoDB, Aurora
- **Networking**: VPC, CloudFront, Route 53
- **Security**: IAM, Security Groups, NACLs
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch, CloudTrail

#### Key Concepts ✓
- Shared Responsibility Model details
- Well-Architected Framework pillars
- EC2 pricing models and use cases
- S3 storage classes and selection criteria
- IAM components and best practices
- High Availability vs Fault Tolerance

#### Common Question Patterns ✓
- **"Which is the customer's responsibility?"** → Think Shared Responsibility Model
- **"Most cost-effective solution?"** → Consider usage patterns and pricing models
- **"Highest availability?"** → Multi-AZ, multiple regions
- **"Fastest performance?"** → Consider service characteristics and limitations

### Exam Day Strategy

#### Time Management
- **90 minutes** for 65 questions = ~1.4 minutes per question
- **First pass**: Answer questions you know immediately
- **Second pass**: Tackle remaining questions
- **Flag difficult** questions for review

#### Question Approach
1. **Read carefully**: Note keywords like "most", "least", "cost-effective"
2. **Eliminate wrong answers**: Use process of elimination
3. **Look for AWS-specific solutions**: Don't choose generic cloud answers
4. **Consider the scenario**: Match AWS services to use cases

#### Common Traps
- **Similar services**: Know differences (EBS vs EFS, SNS vs SQS)
- **Pricing models**: Understand when to use each EC2 pricing option
- **Responsibility boundaries**: Clear on AWS vs customer responsibilities
- **Service limitations**: Know service-specific constraints

### Key Formulas & Numbers
- **S3 durability**: 99.999999999% (11 9's)
- **Lambda timeout**: 15 minutes maximum
- **Free tier EC2**: 750 hours t2.micro per month
- **RDS backup retention**: 0-35 days
- **EBS snapshot**: Incremental, stored in S3
