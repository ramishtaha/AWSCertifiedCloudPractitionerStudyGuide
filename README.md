## Domain 1: Cloud Concepts (26%)

### What is Cloud Computing?
Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.

> **Real-World Analogy:** Think of cloud computing like electricity from a utility company. You don't need to build your own power plant (data center), you just plug in (connect to the internet) and pay for what you use.

**Key Characteristics:**
- **On-demand self-service**: Provision resources automatically without human interaction
- **Broad network access**: Available over the network via standard mechanisms
- **Resource pooling**: Multi-tenant model with dynamic assignment
- **Rapid elasticity**: Scale up or down quickly based on demand
- **Measured service**: Pay-per-use or subscription model

### Six Advantages of Cloud Computing

1. **Trade capital expense for variable expense**
   - No upfront costs, pay only for what you consume
   - Convert CapEx to OpEx
   - **Example**: Instead of buying $100,000 worth of servers, pay $1,000/month for what you actually use

2. **Benefit from massive economies of scale**
   - AWS achieves higher economies of scale
   - Lower variable costs than you can achieve on your own
   - **AWS Scale**: Serves millions of customers globally, reducing costs for everyone

3. **Stop guessing about capacity**
   - Eliminate guessing on infrastructure capacity needs
   - Scale up/down as needed
   - **Real Example**: Black Friday traffic spikes can be handled automatically

4. **Increase speed and agility**
   - Resources available in minutes, not weeks
   - Experiment quickly with low cost and risk
   - **Developer Benefit**: Spin up test environments in minutes, not days

5. **Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers**
   - Focus on customers, not infrastructure
   - Let AWS handle the heavy lifting
   - **Business Focus**: Spend time on your core business, not IT infrastructure

6. **Go global in minutes**
   - Deploy applications in multiple regions worldwide
   - Lower latency and better customer experience
   - **Global Reach**: Deploy to 32+ regions with a few clicks   - Deploy applications in multiple regions worldwide

### Identity and Access Management (IAM)

> **üîë IAM Fundamentals:** IAM is free, global (not region-specific), and follows the principle of least privilege.

#### Core Components

**Users**
- **Definition**: Represents a person or application that interacts with AWS
- **Credentials**: Has permanent long-term credentials (access keys, passwords)
- **Default**: No permissions (implicit deny)
- **Best Practice**: Create individual users, don't share credentials
- **Limits**: 5,000 users per AWS account
- **Examples**: John Smith (developer), monitoring-app (application)

**Groups**
- **Definition**: Collection of users under one set of permissions
- **Inheritance**: Users inherit group permissions
- **Nesting**: Cannot be nested (no groups within groups)
- **Use cases**: Job functions (Developers, Admins, ReadOnly)
- **Best Practice**: Assign permissions to groups, not individual users
- **Examples**: Developers group, Finance group, HR group

**Roles**
- **Definition**: Set of permissions that can be assumed temporarily
- **Credentials**: Temporary security credentials (no permanent access keys)
- **Assumption**: Can be assumed by users, applications, or AWS services
- **Cross-Account**: Enable access across AWS accounts
- **Use cases**: EC2 instances, Lambda functions, cross-account access
- **Duration**: Temporary (15 minutes to 12 hours)

**Policies**
- **Format**: JSON documents defining permissions
- **Function**: Define what actions are allowed/denied on which resources
- **Attachment**: Can be attached to users, groups, or roles
- **Types**: AWS managed, customer managed, inline policies
- **Evaluation**: Explicit deny always wins

#### IAM Policy Structure

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::mybucket/*",
      "Condition": {
        "IpAddress": {
          "aws:SourceIp": "203.0.113.0/24"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Policy Elements Explained:**
- **Version**: Policy language version (always use "2012-10-17")
- **Statement**: Main policy element containing permissions
- **Effect**: Allow or Deny
- **Action**: AWS service actions (s3:GetObject, ec2:StartInstances)
- **Resource**: AWS resource ARN the action applies to
- **Condition**: Optional constraints for when policy applies

#### IAM Best Practices

1. **Enable MFA** for all users, especially root account
   - *Adds extra layer of security beyond passwords*
2. **Principle of least privilege** - Grant minimal permissions needed
   - *Start with no access, add permissions as needed*
3. **Use roles for applications** running on EC2/Lambda
   - *Avoid hardcoding access keys in applications*
4. **Rotate credentials regularly**
   - *Change passwords and access keys periodically*
5. **Use groups** to assign permissions to users
   - *Easier management than individual user permissions*
6. **Monitor activity** with CloudTrail
   - *Track who did what and when*
7. **Remove unnecessary users and permissions**
   - *Regular access reviews and cleanup*
8. **Use strong password policies**
   - *Minimum length, complexity requirements, rotation*
9. **Never share access keys**
   - *Each user should have unique credentials*
10. **Use AWS managed policies** when possible
    - *AWS maintains and updates these policies*

#### IAM Policy Types

**AWS Managed Policies**
- **Maintained by**: AWS
- **Updates**: Automatically updated by AWS
- **Examples**: PowerUserAccess, ReadOnlyAccess, AdministratorAccess
- **Best for**: Common use cases, standard permissions

**Customer Managed Policies**
- **Maintained by**: You
- **Versioning**: Can create multiple versions
- **Reusability**: Can attach to multiple users/groups/roles
- **Best for**: Custom permissions specific to your organization

**Inline Policies**
- **Attachment**: Directly attached to single user, group, or role
- **Relationship**: One-to-one relationship
- **Use case**: Exceptions or unique permissions
- **Drawback**: Harder to manage and reuse
